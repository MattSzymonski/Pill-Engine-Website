# Pill-Engine Guide

This project builds a static Pill Engine Guide website, serving as the primary reference documentation for developing projects with Pill Engine.

## Development

All readable content is located in the `./pages` directory as markdown files. Creating subdirectories within `pages` will automatically organize the content in the sidebar navigation.
