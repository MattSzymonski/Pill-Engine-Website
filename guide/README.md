# Pill Guide

This project builds a static Pill Guide website, serving as the  primary reference documentation for developing projects with Pill.

## Development

All readable content is located in the `./pages` directory as markdown files. Creating subdirectories within `pages` will automatically organize the content in the sidebar navigation.
